# TUI Simplification - Changes Made

## Overview
The TUI main menu has been simplified from 5 options to just 2 essential options:

### Previous Menu Structure
```
1. Session Name
2. Project Type
3. Pane Count
4. Create Workspace
5. Quit
```

### New Simplified Menu
```
1. Open Running Session  - Attach to existing tmux session
2. Create New Workspace  - Create a new development workspace
3. Quit                 - Exit tmux wizard
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Main Menu (`tui_draw_main_menu`)
- Reduced from 5 options to 3 (2 functional + quit)
- Added descriptive text for each option when selected
- Cleaner, more focused interface

### 2. New Workflow: "Open Running Session"
- Immediately shows list of existing tmux sessions
- User can select a session to attach to
- Handles both `tmux attach` and `tmux switch-client` based on context
- Shows "No active sessions found" if none exist

### 3. New Workflow: "Create New Workspace"
The full creation flow is now:
1. **Session Name Input** → Enter workspace name
2. **Project Type Selection** → Choose project type (nextjs/generic/none)
3. **Method Selection** → (Only for Next.js) Choose create method
4. **Theme Selection** → (Only for create-next-app) Choose theme
5. **Pane Configuration** → Select number of panes
6. **Confirmation** → Review and create workspace

### 4. Navigation Improvements
- Back navigation now follows the logical flow
- Each step leads naturally to the next
- Configuration summary only shows during workspace creation
- No need to return to main menu between configuration steps

## File Changes

### `/lib/tui.sh`
- **Lines 132-156**: Updated `tui_draw_main_menu()` with new options and descriptions
- **Lines 159-196**: Added new `tui_draw_session_list()` function
- **Lines 197-210**: Added new `tui_draw_session_name()` function  
- **Lines 91-97**: Updated state machine to include new states
- **Lines 335-367**: Updated `tui_handle_selection()` for new workflow
- **Lines 289-328**: Enhanced `tui_handle_input()` with session name handling
- **Lines 438-447**: Updated `tui_go_back()` navigation logic

## Testing

Run the test script to see the new interface:
```bash
./test-tui.sh
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Users face fewer initial decisions
2. **Clearer Intent**: Two distinct paths - attach to existing or create new
3. **Streamlined Creation**: All configuration happens in a logical flow
4. **Better UX**: Descriptive text helps users understand each option
5. **Preserved Functionality**: All original features are still accessible

## Integration

The changes maintain full compatibility with the existing tmux-wizard infrastructure:
- Still exports the same variables (`SESSION_NAME`, `PROJECT_TYPE`, etc.)
- Works with existing project and template managers
- Maintains the same final output format
- No changes needed to the main script integration
